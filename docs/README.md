# aste
aste stands for Artificial Solver Testing Environment for preCICE. aste facilitates getting data into preCICE and out of it. An overview is given by the following figure:

aste consists of compiled C++ Modules and of Python modules.

## Python modules
### make_mesh.py
Create a simple text mesh on `[x0, x1] x [y0, y1]` with `nx x ny` points. The mesh is 3-dimensional, with the z-component set to 0.

### eval_mesh.py
Reads a mesh as either `.vtk` or `.txt` and evaluates a function given by `-f` on it. The function gets the mesh points a numpy array of the form `x = [[x_1, y_1, z_1], ...]` and should store the result in `y`.

### partition_mesh.py
Reads a mesh as either `.vtk` or `.txt`, partitions it and stores the parts in a directory like `dirname/0, 1, ...`. For partitioning two algorithms are available. The meshfree algorithm does not need any mesh topology information, whereas the topological algorithm needs topology information. This python module needs the C++ module `libmetisAPI.so` if the topological algorithm is used.

### join_mesh.py
Reads a partitioned mesh from a directory like `dirname/0, 1, ...` and saves it to a single file.

### libMetisAPI
This is a small C++ wrapper around METIS. It is only required if `partition_mesh.py` should use a topological algorithm. 

### preciceMap
This is a C++ application, which does the coupling through precice. It expects a mesh in the format given by `partition_mesh.py`.

## Dependencies

### C++ modules
##### Required
- preCICE
- MPI
- CMake
##### Optional
- METIS

### Python modules
##### Required
- NumPy
##### Optional
- vtk (Visualization Toolkit)
- scipy

## Building
Make sure to have all the needed dependencies installed. Then do:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
If precice is not installed in `$PRECICE_ROOT/build` do `cmake -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=$PRECICE_INSTALL_DIR ..` with the correct installation directory.

### on SuperMUC
Initialize environment, e.g., put in your `.bashrc`
```
# METIS for aste
module load metis
export METIS_DIR=$METIS_BASE # so that cmake finds metis
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$METIS_BASE/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
```
and execute cmake like `cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ ..` and `make`.



## Demo
A demonstration of aste can be run with `./demo.sh`. A bunny-shaped mesh is mapped onto a red blood cell. The result can be seen in `result.vtk`.
